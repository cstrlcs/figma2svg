## Overview üìñ

The **figma2svg** script automates the extraction of SVG icons from a Figma project, converting them into a spritesheet and JSON list.

The project's primary goal is to streamline the process of integrating custom icons from Figma designs into web development projects.

---

## Features üåü

- Fetch SVG icons from a Figma document.
- Process icons to ensure "**currentColor**" on both fill and stroke.
- Generate a single SVG spritesheet for all icons.
- Produce a JSON list of icons for easy reference and integration.

---

## Getting Started üöÄ

**_Requirements_**

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- **Python**: `version 3.6+`

You will also need a Figma access token to use the API (**file key** and **personal access token**). You can obtain these by following the instructions [here](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens).

### Installation

1. Clone the figma2svg repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cstrlcs/figma2svg
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```sh
cd figma2svg
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running `figma2svg`

Use the following command to run figma2svg:

```sh
python main.py
```

This will fetch the icons from your Figma file, process them into SVG format, compile them into a spritesheet, and generate a JSON list of the icons for integration into your web projects.

It may take a while, since we don't want to overload Figma's servers with too many requests.
